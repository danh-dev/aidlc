# AIDLC

**See what AI is building. Drive Claude through any pipeline you declare — and track every run, step, and token.**

Drive Claude through any pipeline you declare in a single `workspace.yaml` — visually from VS Code, or from the terminal. Agents, skills, pipelines, and epics share one source of truth; both surfaces stay in sync within ~200ms.

## Features

- **Workspace Builder** — main-area panel with agent / skill / pipeline cards, reorder, on-failure toggle, inline skill editor
- **Analyze Requirements** — import requirements from **Jira**, **GitHub Issues**, **Linear**, **Redmine**, or a local file into a `requirements.md` in your project. The "Analyze" tab in the Builder drives the interactive wizard; `aidlc analyze` does the same from the terminal
- **Test Agent** — a "Tests" tab that integrates [`aidlc-testagent`](https://github.com/aidlc-io/aidlc-testagent) (`ata`) for AI-powered E2E tests. Shows the full **Explore → Plan → Confirm → Generate → Execute → Heal → Verdict** pipeline, lists targets from `testagent.config.yaml` with per-target **Plan** / **Run** buttons and a settings editor — no terminal needed for day-to-day test runs
- **Epics & runs** — bind a pipeline to a work item, then walk it step-by-step. **Approve** advances; **reject** cascades feedback to the producing step (auto-resets downstream); **rerun** with optional new context. Runs display by **step name**, not agent name
- **Smart Start Epic** — describe the work in one line and AIDLC suggests a task-type **recipe** (`bugfix`, `small-feature`, `refactor`, `feature-parallel`, `large-feature`, `spike`) and assembles the pipeline. No pipeline yet? Load the SDLC example or create one inline. Older workspaces get recipes back-filled automatically
- **AIDLC Monitor** — a status bar item plus a panel with **Token Usage**, **Insights**, and **Agents** tabs. The Agents tab embeds the [agents-observe](https://github.com/simple10/agents-observe) dashboard to watch live agent sessions and history. When the server is down it offers a one-click **Start Monitor** that can auto-install the plugin (Docker if available, otherwise a local runtime — no Docker required)
- **Session Insights** — a native dashboard built entirely from the Claude Code transcript (`~/.claude/projects/**.jsonl`) — no plugin, no server, no Docker. Session picker plus seven panels: overview, context+cache chart over turns, hooks (with errors), agents/subagents, prompts, context management (compactions / peak / file edits), retrieval and tool usage. Updates live while a session runs
- **Live OTel strip** — a minimal OTLP/JSON receiver for Claude Code's native telemetry, with one-click "enable telemetry" that writes the env to `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Sidebar webview** — clickable **Agents / Skills / Flows / Epics** tiles that open the matching view, plus live counts and active runs
- **Load Demo Project** — one click drops a full SDLC pipeline + 6 sample epics into `.aidlc/`, no YAML to write
- **Add Skill wizard** — 4 sources: load template, paste markdown, upload a `.md` file, or open a blank file. Starter templates: hello-world, code-reviewer, test-converter, doc-writer, release-notes
- **Add Agent wizard** — id, display name, skill picker, model picker (Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.7 / Haiku 4.5)
- **Add Pipeline wizard** — pick each step's name then its agent, set **"Runs after"** dependencies and on-failure behavior (stop / continue); **rename**, **duplicate**, or **Load AIDLC default**. Slash commands are namespaced per pipeline so multiple pipelines never collide
- **Workspace templates** — save the whole workspace as a named preset and reapply it in any project. Built-ins: `code-review`, `release-notes`, `sdlc`
- **Built-in Claude CLI terminal** — one-click zsh terminal in the bottom panel with the `claude` CLI auto-launched
- **Workspace inspector** — dump the parsed, validated, env-resolved `workspace.yaml` to the output channel
- **Interactive walkthrough** — open the Welcome page → "Get started with AIDLC" for a 6-step tour

## How It Works

The extension reads `.aidlc/workspace.yaml` from the open folder and uses [`@aidlc/core`](../core) to validate the schema (Zod), resolve env variables, load skills and agents, and execute pipelines through the Claude CLI runner.

```
.aidlc/
├── workspace.yaml          # agents · skills · pipelines · sidebar layout
├── skills/                 # markdown prompts for each skill
├── epics/                  # work items bound to a pipeline
└── runs/                   # state of every run, watched live by both UIs
```

Both the extension and the `aidlc` CLI read and write the same files atomically — switch between them mid-run without losing state.

## Getting Started

1. Install **AIDLC** from the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX.
2. Open a workspace folder.
3. The Welcome page auto-opens the **Get started with AIDLC** walkthrough — follow it for a guided tour, or skip ahead with the steps below.
4. Run **AIDLC: Load Demo Project** — scaffolds a full pipeline plus 6 sample epics under `.aidlc/`.
5. Click the **AIDLC** icon in the activity bar to open the sidebar; pick an epic to run.
6. Use **AIDLC: Open Claude CLI Terminal** to drive runs (or run pipelines unattended) from the CLI.

Prefer to start from scratch? Use **AIDLC: Init Sample Workspace** instead — it scaffolds an empty `.aidlc/workspace.yaml` plus a `hello-skill.md`.

# Unit Tests for Epic $0

You are the **Developer (Dev)** agent — a senior polyglot engineer.
Load your full persona from `.claude/agents/developer.md` before starting.

## Step 0: Pipeline Gate Check
Read and execute `.claude/skills/_gate-check.md`. This skill = phase `unit-test`, epic = `$0`. If gate fails → STOP.

## Context to read first
1. The **feature branch code** produced by the `implement` phase (`feature/$0-…`)
2. **Test plan**: `docs/epics/$0/TEST-PLAN.md` — the unit-test cases (`$0-UT*`) you must cover
3. **PRD**: `docs/epics/$0/PRD.md` — acceptance criteria the tests must protect
4. **Existing tests** near the changed code — match the framework, fixtures, and mock conventions

## Steps
1. On the same `feature/$0-…` branch, add unit tests for the new / changed code.
2. Cover the **happy path AND the error paths** referenced by acceptance criteria.
3. Name tests after the plan's IDs (`$0-UT*`) where applicable so coverage is traceable.
4. Make tests **deterministic** — fixed seeds, injected clock, no live network or
   real filesystem. Mark tests that genuinely need hardware / a live service.
5. Run the project's unit-test command; every new test must pass before handoff.
6. Write a short summary to `docs/epics/$0/artifacts/UNIT-TEST-SUMMARY.md`:
   files / cases added, which TEST-PLAN unit items are covered, and anything
   intentionally skipped (with why).

## Rules
- Test **behavior, not implementation details** — don't assert on private internals.
- Clear arrange / act / assert; one logical assertion per test where practical.
- Don't weaken an assertion to make a flaky test pass — fix the flake (usually a
  timing or ordering assumption).
- Don't add tests for impossible states the type system already rules out.
